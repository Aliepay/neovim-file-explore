this is a repository about my file explore in neovim
1. the nvim-tree occur some problem on my machine.

2. i learn some other file explores on reddit such as oil.nvim and mini.file. And i find that some people don't use single explore but two. So i am going to practice.(For the nvim-tree.lua, i want to add enable=false to this plugin)
